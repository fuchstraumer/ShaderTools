- Add unit and integration tests
- Figure out if we can do a debug info compile to get reflection info, and then a stripped compile for the binary that the API will actually use for PSO creation
    - In this vein, allow us to retry failed compiles with reduced optimizations to see what works
- Identify how much more info we can pack into the YAML file to allow for the definition of PSOs entirely in data
    - Will need to identify in these requests what vulkan extensions and features are needed to do this, and save them in the data as well
- Identify a new binary format for the generated content
- Fix the horrendous mess of threading bugs that is the file tracker. What was I thinking?
    - This could be made into something that runs per-session like the error session system as well
- Source location parsing for errors when generating source text. Include handling would be nice too, but need to figure out how that works with shaderc
    - This would allow us to compile the include sources ahead of time, and parse them for errors. Kinda like a language server!
- Change shader yaml spec to be "ComputeShader" for compute shaders, use "RenderShaders" + (Stage) as next subgroup for rendering shaders. More succinct, more clear.
- Reduce lambda function usage. Untestable, hidden, cluttered.
