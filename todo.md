- Add handling of acceleration structures to the generator, as right now the reflection system could handle them but we can't actually use/generate them 
- Add unit and integration tests
- Identify how much more info we can pack into the YAML file to allow for the definition of PSOs entirely in data
    - Will need to identify in these requests what vulkan extensions and features are needed to do this, and save them in the data as well
- Identify a new binary format for the generated content
- Source location parsing for errors when generating source text. Include handling would be nice too, but need to figure out how that works with shaderc
    - This would allow us to compile the include sources ahead of time, and parse them for errors. Kinda like a language server!
- Preprocess includes for errors and warnings, if possible, so that the line numbers in the errors and warnings match the original source code
