- Add handling of acceleration structures to the generator, as right now the reflection system could handle them but we can't actually use/generate them 
- Add unit and integration tests
- Identify how much more info we can pack into the YAML file to allow for the definition of PSOs entirely in data
    - Will need to identify in these requests what vulkan extensions and features are needed to do this, and save them in the data as well
- Identify a new binary format for the generated content
- Generator now needs to extract type information and a name from the specialization constants it parses, so that we can correlate that with what reflection finds
    - Reflection system no longer gives type info, but does give name and binding index. This will allow us to reduce it down to only use SPCs, at least.
- Structure support for interface inputs and outputs: Will help with possible eventual HLSL support, and will let us clean things up a bit.
    - Potentially look at making it so we auto-generate locations even in cases of interface overrides if we use this
