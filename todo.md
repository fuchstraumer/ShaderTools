- Add handling of acceleration structures to the generator, as right now the reflection system could handle them but we can't actually use/generate them 
- Add unit and integration tests
- Figure out if we can do a debug info compile to get reflection info, and then a stripped compile for the binary that the API will actually use for PSO creation
    - In this vein, allow us to retry failed compiles with reduced optimizations to see what works
- Identify how much more info we can pack into the YAML file to allow for the definition of PSOs entirely in data
    - Will need to identify in these requests what vulkan extensions and features are needed to do this, and save them in the data as well
- Identify a new binary format for the generated content
- Source location parsing for errors when generating source text. Include handling would be nice too, but need to figure out how that works with shaderc
    - This would allow us to compile the include sources ahead of time, and parse them for errors. Kinda like a language server!
- Reduce lambda function usage. Untestable, hidden, cluttered.
- Preprocess includes for errors and warnings, if possible, so that the line numbers in the errors and warnings match the original source code
- Review usage of strdup to see if we couldn't use string_view, or some way to keep the strings alive in our storage so we can just use pointers
