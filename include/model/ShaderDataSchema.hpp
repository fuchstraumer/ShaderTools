/** The schema the cooker extracts and the rendergraph eventually consumes. It names no Slang, WebGPU,

 * that leaks into it becomes a dependency the engine must carry.
 *
 * The enums live in shader/ShaderLibraryTypes.hpp, because the graph reads the same vocabulary. This
 * schema adds only the parts that the offline tool needs: owning strings, and the raw expression text
 * that a diagnostic must quote. 
 * 
 * todo-ship: refactor this into a true C ABI. We have patterns from prev ShaderTools iteration for 
 * passing data like strings across DLL boundary, so we can do this just fine.*/
