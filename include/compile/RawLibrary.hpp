/** What stage 3 produces: everything the compiler said, and no opinion about any of it.
 *
 * Stage 3 is the only stage that talks to Slang.The interfaces name and use no Slang types,
 * so that dependencies on the compiler can stay precisely isolated to this stage. It carries
 * through our meta-annotations without interpreting them, ensuring that stage 4 can evaluate
 * those alongside the retrieved compiler information to fully build resource information
 * (thus why it's the "resolve" step)
 *
 * A binding record here holds **placement** and the shape of the resource. It holds no visibility and
 * no footprint, because those have different keys and different lifetimes. Additionally, most of our
 * visiblity and footprint information is dependent on the permutation system and is highly
 * variant-specific.*/
