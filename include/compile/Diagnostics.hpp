/** A diagnostic is a record, and a sink decides what becomes of it. 
 *
 * So the boundary parses, and everything after the boundary reports. **A stage must never format a
 * diagnostic string.** It fills a record and hands the record to a sink.
 *
 * The record takes its shape from the Language Server Protocol `Diagnostic` type: a range, a
 * severity, a code, a message, and related information. Editors already read that shape, so a future
 * language server needs a translation and not a redesign.
 *
 * `SlangDiagnosticParser.hpp` is where the compiler's own format is understood, and it understands it as
