/** The frozen model every emitter reads.

 * One cook builds this once. The C++ emitter, the binary manifest emitter, and the dedup report all
 * read the same object, so two artifacts of one cook cannot describe different shaders.
 *
 * A variant does not hold its source text. It holds an index into the module's source table. Today
 * that table has one entry for each artifact, so the indices are an identity mapping. Dedup replaces
 * how the table gets filled, and nothing else changes: the emitters already read through the index.
