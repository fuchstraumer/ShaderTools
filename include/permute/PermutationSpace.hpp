/**
 * One variant's identity.
 *
 * `Active`: Contains only the axes this variant actually uses. The linker uses this to export the final
 * values (i.e., what shows up in source)
 *
 * `Canonical`: A complete list of EVERY axis in the permutation space, in declaration order. This is
 * *not* what the shader will actually use.
 *
 * If an axis is disabled, it will not appear in Active but it will appear in Canonical. This happens with
 * an axis (or axes) whose parent does not match the value required to enable it. The permutation evaluator
 * will fill in the first value of that axis as the value in Canonical.
 *
 * Why? Because this then provides a truly stable index for the variant, which several properties/values we
 * associate with a variant are computed. This also makes it simpler for further retrieval: we don't need to
 * know the fully evaluated "correct" value of each axis to retrieve it, we can just use our unique values
 * and the canonicalized values to retrieve the variant. Think how trivial that is: if you know just the
 * set of values you want to use, you can get your variant.
