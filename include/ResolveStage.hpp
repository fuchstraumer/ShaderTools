/**Pipeline Stage 4. Turns what the compiler said into what the runtime needs.
 *
 * This file names no Slang type, and it must not gain one. That is the whole point of the split: the
 * arithmetic that decides every buffer size in the engine is a pure function of a `RawVariant` and a
 * symbol table, so it has a test that runs in milliseconds and needs no compiler, and a second target
 * language reuses it unchanged.
 *
 * The symbol table is the only input that does not come from stage 3, and it has two halves. The axis
 * values come from the variant's canonical assignment. The `extern static const` constants that no
 * axis drives keep their declared defaults, and only Slang knows those, so stage 3 carries them out in
 * `RawModule::ExternDefaults`. */
