 * compiles into the program. The manifest form arrives as bytes, so a live cooker can replace it while
 * the program runs.
 *
 * Every section starts on an 8-byte boundary, because the binding records and the axis values hold
 * 64-bit fields. The reader maps the bytes in place and does not copy them.
