/** Writes one point between two stages as JSON, so a change between two stages is a diff and not a
 * search.
 *
 * A dump goes through the `OutputSink` like every other artifact. That means three key things:
 *
 * - `MemoryOutputSink` captures a dump, so a test reads one without touching a disk.
 * - `--verify-deterministic` compares every artifact the sink holds, so it compares the dumps. An
 *   unordered container that reaches a dump then fails the cook.
 * - A dump file is named the way every other artifact is named.
 *
 * A dump holds no shader source code. A source appears as an index, a byte length, and a content hash.
 * That's all we need to diff and verify idempotence */
